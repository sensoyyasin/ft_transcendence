# Overview

The main purpose of the project was to create a game using the SPA (Single Page Application) method with Vanilla JavaScript and the Bootstrap framework on the frontend. 
The entry pages covered essential topics such as the underlying mathematics of the game, the positions of paddles, and how the ball moves. Instead of using machine learning in AI mode, we utilized their own structures.
Profile settings were functional, and there was a matchmaking system in the tournament mode. 
Winner pages were created, and overall, the frontend was well-designed. User data and match history were stored in the database, which was implemented using PostgreSQL. 
Authorization with HTTPS was implemented in the nginx part. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, all mandatory parts of the project were completed. 
Major modules included a framework as the backend, standard user management, remote authentication, and AI. 
Minor modules included a frontend framework, database for the backend, game customization options, GDPR compliance, expanding browser compatibility, and multiple language support. 
There were no missing parts in the project. Additionally, we implemented chat with WebSocket in the project, but since WSS was not implemented, I did not include it in the evaluation.

# Compile & Start the Project

You can compile the project with make . Dockers for both frontend and backend will be started up. Everything must be launched with a single command line to run an autonomous container provided by Docker. For example: docker-compose up --build
